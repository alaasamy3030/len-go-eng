Joseph never opens the front door. When someone knocks on the front door, Joseph says, "Who is it?" But he does not open the door. His parents told him to keep the door closed. His parents want him to be safe. He will be safe if he doesn't open the door. Yesterday someone knocked on the front door. "Who is it?" Joseph asked. "It's the mailman," the person sa  . "I cannot open the door," Joseph sa  . "Okay, I will come back tomorrow," the mailman sa  . "Goodbye," Joseph sa  . Joseph is a good boy. He listens to his parents. He doesn't open the door for any person.
