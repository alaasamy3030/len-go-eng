Deborah was angry at her son. Her son d  n't listen to her. Her son was 16 years old. Her son thought he knew everything. Her son yelled at Deborah. He told her he d  n't have to do anything. He d  n't have to listen to her. He d  n't have to go to school. He d  n't have to do his homework. He d  n't have to study. He was 16. He could do anything he wanted to do. What could Deborah do? She wasn't married. She was divorced. She could not control her son. He would listen to his father. But his father was not there. His father lived in another city.
